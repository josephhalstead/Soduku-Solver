"""
A program to solve soduku by Joseph Halstead

The solving algorithm works in two main parts:

Part 1: Loading the soduku board

1) Create an instance of the soduku board class.
2) Call the initialise function on the soduku board which fills its .board attribute
   with 81 instances of the Square class.
3) Load a board from a text file using the import_board_from_file function. The text file
   should be formatted as a 9x9 grid. See examples in the /tests folder.

Part 2: Depth First Search

1) Create a stack and push the inital soduku board onto it.
2) Enter a while loop
3) Load the next node soduku board to try by popping the stack.
4) If the soduku is solved - break the while loop and print the completed puzzle.
5) If the soduku is not solved attempt to fill in the remaining digits by iteratively
   eliminating the possibilities that each square can take (repeat_solve function).
6) If the soduku is valid after the possibility elimination i.e there are no logical
   contradictions then get the square with the lowest remaining possibilities and create
   child node soduku boards where these possibilities are guessed.
7) Push these child node soduku boards onto the stack.
8) Loop
